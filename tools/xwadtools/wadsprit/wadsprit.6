.SH DISCLAIMER
This program is furnished on an AS IS basis for the fun of it.
id Software, Raven Software and Activision do not support this program.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The program takes a WAD file (either IWAD or PWAD) as input, and decompiles
all sprites used for monsters, weapons, explosions and so on found between
the S_START or SS_START and S_END markers into ppm graphic files.
.P
A sprite named \fBFRED\fP would be saved as \fB./sprites/fred.ppm\fP.
If the \fB./sprites\fP directory does not already exist, it is created.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-c\fP \fIpalette\fP
By default the program uses the Doom palette for the color table lookup.
With this option another palette can be used, \fIpalette\fP can be \fBdoom\fP,
\fBheretic\fP, \fBhexen\fP or \fBstrife\fP.
.TP
.B \-p
Preserve case. Prevent the name of the graphic files to be forced to
lower case. For example, a sprite named \fBFRED\fP would be saved as
.B ./sprites/FRED.ppm
.TP
\fB\-w\fP \fIexpr\fP
Extract only the sprites whose names match the wildcard expression \fIexpr\fP.
By default, all sprites are extracted.
The matching is done by calling \fBfnmatch\fP(3) with the \fIflags\fP argument
set to 0.
The strings are uppercased before they're passed to fnmatch() so that the
matching is case-insensitive.
All usual shell wildcards apply:

.ta 2 12
.nf
	\fB*\fP matches zero or more characters
	\fB?\fP matches one character
	\fB[\fIrange\fB]\fR     matches one character in \fIrange\fP
	\fB[!\fIrange\fB]\fR    matches one character not in \fIrange\fP
	\fB\\*\fP       matches \fB*\fP
	\fB\\?\fP       matches \fB?\fP
	\fB\\[\fP       matches \fB[\fP
	\fB\\\\\fP      matches \fB\\\fP
	\fIother\fP     matches itself
.fi

See \fBfnmatch\fP(3) for more details.

.SH SUPPORTED GAMES

.SH BUGS/ERRORS
Microsoft OS's can't write files with a \\ in the filename and some
sprites in id's IWAD's have them in the name. For now the program just
will count the number of files it can't create and go on.
