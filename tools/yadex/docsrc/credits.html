		<h2>DEU</h2>

<p>Yadex is derived from DEU 5.21 that was written by Raphaël
Quinet, Brendon Wyber and others. I am deeply indebted to them
as, if they had not written DEU 5.21 and, more importantly, had
not kindly released the source code, Yadex wouldn't exist.

<p>Here are the credits from the DEU 5.21 documentation&nbsp;:

<p><pre>* Everybody at id Software for making such great games!

* Brendon Wyber                   (ma+pn+lehoerganp+pfp=erolj.o)
     The first version of this program was written by Brendon Wyber.
     Map display, Things editor.

* Raphaël Quinet                  (ro+pn+tyh+rebvsrgabz=gravhd)
     Much of this program was written by Raphaël Quinet.
     New interface (mouse, menus, etc).
     Ability to edit Vertices, Linedefs, Sidedefs, Sectors, and last
     but certainly not least an AUTOMATIC NODES BUILDER.
     Even if I rewrote nearly 90% of the code, this editor still has its
     strong DEU roots... :-)

* Matt Fell                       (zbp+foorpn=ggraeho.ggnz)
     Author of the great Unofficial Doom Specs.  Making this program
     would have been impossible if the Specs didn't exist.

* Steve Bareman                   (hqr+rcbu+gvp+rcbu=anzreno)
     Rewrote the documentation (this file and DEU.TXT)
     Author of the DEU tutorial (look in the TUTOR directory).
     Constant promoter of including source code with the editor.
     For a good FTP...
         anonymous @ hope.cit.hope.edu (198.110.98.2)
        (Registered DOOM patches, DEU, and various doom utils for
         Registered DOOMers only.)

* Trevor Phillips                 (hn+hqr+avgehp+pp=cvyyvuce)
     Textures viewer in 256 colors

     Lots of infos about the Nodes objects.
     They fixed the bug(s) in my Nodes builder.
     Looking for cute Doom add-ons?  Get BSP and ZAMBONY!

     Drop-down menus and menu bar.
     Rewrote and reorganized part of this file.
     Numerous improvements and suggestions.
     Now working on a GIF support for DEU.

          the best DOOM FTP server: infant2.sphs.indiana.edu
          (DOOM add-ons and utils, collection of WAD files, ...)
     Also sent some useful suggestions and bug reports.
     The first martyr of the DOOM cause: his first ftp site (ocf.unt.edu)
     has been closed by short-minded academic authorities.  &lt;sob!&gt;

* Sven Neuhaus                    (rq+tavc+lyyvy=arif)
* Billy Chow                      (xh+pn+qebskb+taverravtar=jbup.lyyvo)
     The most efficient beta-testers!  They keep on finding bugs that
     most other people never see...

* Tom Neff                        (zbp+kvanc=ssrag)
     Not only a good beta-tester, but also the author of the WIF Specs,

     used internally by id Software.
