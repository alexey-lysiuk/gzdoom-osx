	<h2><a name="introduction">
	1. Introduction</a></h2>

		<h3>Yadex in one paragraph</h3>

<p>Yadex is a Doom level (wad) editor for Unix systems running
X, including Linux. It supports Doom, Doom II, Ultimate Doom,
Final Doom, Heretic and also, in a more or less limited way,
Hexen and Strife. It is available under the terms of the GPL.

		<h3><a name="prerequisites">What do I need ?</a></h3>

<p>To compile, install and run this release of Yadex, you need
<ul>
<li>a POSIX-compatible environment (such as Unix),
<li>an ISO-compliant C/C++ compiler
<li>GNU make (it won't work with other flavours of make),
<li>an HTML viewer to read the doc,
<li>a Doom/Doom II/Heretic iwad.
<li>X11R6 or X11R5.
</ul>

<p>More specifically, Yadex expects that
<ul>
<li>the routines in <code>ctype.h</code> accept the range
	<code>CHAR_MIN</code> through <code>UCHAR_MAX</code>,
<li>the C library has the <code>hypot()</code> function,
<li>either the <code>nanosleep()</code> or the
	<code>usleep()</code> system call is supported.
</ul>

		<h4>Iwad</h4>

<p>A shareware Doom/Heretic/Strife iwad is okay but you need a
registered iwad if you want to be able to save your changes.

		<h4>Directories</h4>

<p>Yadex conforms to the <a href="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">
FHS (filesystem hierarchy standard)</a>.
The installation procedure will try to copy files in the following
directories, creating the directories if they don't exist ;
<ul>
<li><code>/etc/yadex/$VERSION</code>
<li><code>/usr/local/bin</code>
<li><code>/usr/local/share/games/yadex/$VERSION</code>
</ul>
<p>So make sure you have the necessary rights before installing
(or install in a different location).

		<h4>Display</h4>

<p>Yadex uses about 270 different colours. In most cases, on
PseudoColor displays, there aren't that many free colour cells.
So, if it detects a PseudoColor display, Yadex uses a private
colormap so as to get as many free colour cells as possible.
The inconvenient of this method is that, when you're in the
Yadex window, all other windows are displayed with wrong colours
and vice-versa.

<p>What's more, as PseudoColor displays typically have 256
colours (at least on PC), which is less than the number of
colours needed, Yadex might have to assign the same physical
colour to different logical colours. If it happens, it will try
to render the colours of the game accurately at the expense of
the application colours.

<p>Monochrome displays might work but they have not been tested.

<p>Executive summary: if you can, use a TrueColor or DirectColor
display and a depth of more than 8 bits per pixel (E.G. by
launching X with "<code>startx -- -bpp 16</code>").

<p>A 640x480 screen is okay though, of course, a larger display
is better.

	<h3><a name="compiling">Compiling and installing Yadex</a></h3>

See <a href="README"><code>README</code></a>.

<p>Don't forget to tell Yadex where your iwads are by changing
the lines "<code>iwad1&nbsp;=</code>",
"<code>iwad2&nbsp;=</code>" etc. in
<code>~/.yadex/yadex.cfg</code> or
<code>/etc/yadex/$VERSION/yadex.cfg</code> (the actual location
might be different if you compiled with another prefix than the
default). If there is an iwad you don't have, you can just
comment out the corresponding line.

	<h2><a name="quick_start">
	2. Quick start</a></h2>

		<h3>I know nothing about Doom editing</h3>

<p>This section is meant to be a quick introduction to using
Yadex. I assume you already know the basics of Doom editing,
i.e. what vertices, linedefs, sidedefs, things and sectors are
and how they work together. If you don't, it would be good idea
to go get a Doom editing tutorial (see the <a
href="editing_docs.html">list</a>). If at first it seems
confusing, persevere. It worked for me anyway ;-).

		<h3><a name="q_running">
		How do I run Yadex ?</a></h3>

<p>You must have successfully compiled, installed and configured Yadex.
If you haven't, see <a href="users_guide.html#compiling">there</a>.

<p>For the sake of discussion, we'll assume you want to edit MAP01
of Doom II. From the shell, type&nbsp;:
<p>
<code>$ </code><kbd>yadex -g doom2</kbd>
<p>
(of course, you don't have to type the "<code>$</code>" !)<br>
You should see a couple of messages
and then the Yadex prompt, which looks like this&nbsp;:
<p>
<code>yadex: </code>
<p>
At this prompt, type&nbsp;:
<p>
<code>yadex: </code><kbd>e map01</kbd>
<p>
(once again, don't type the "<code>yadex:</code>" string&nbsp;!)<br>
The editor window opens.

		<h3>Moving around in the edit window</h3>

<p>There you are. What you should see now is a window with the map
of the level you wanted to edit.

<br><br><table>
<tr><td><img src="yadex1.png" alt="Screenshot of fresh Yadex window" WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=450>
<tr><td align="right"><i>Fresh Yadex window</i>
</table>

<p>At the top of the window, there is the menu bar.
I assume you know what a menu bar is.
At the bottom of the window, there is the info bar.
It displays some information about your current status&nbsp;:
the name of the level you're editing,
whether it has changed since last saved,
in which editing mode you are,
etc.

<p>Try to move the pointer around. Note that the info bar
shows the position of the pointer in map coordinates.

<p>If you press [<kbd>Left</kbd>], [<kbd>Right</kbd>],
[<kbd>Up</kbd>], [<kbd>Down</kbd>], [<kbd>Home</kbd>],
[<kbd>End</kbd>], [<kbd>Page-up</kbd>] or
[<kbd>Page-down</kbd>], the map scrolls.

<p>You can also zoom in and out by pressing [<kbd>+</kbd>] and
[<kbd>-</kbd>].

		<h3>Highlighting, selecting, dragging, changing properties</h3>

<p>As you are now in "things" mode (as you can see on the info
bar), every time you pass over a thing, it is highlighted and a
window pops up in the bottom left corner of the window that
shows the properties of that thing.

<p>What if you want to change the properties of a thing ?
Double-click on it or highlight it and press
[<kbd>Return</kbd>]. A menu pops up in the top left corner of
the window. Select the property you want to change and yet
another window pops up. Enter the new value of the property and
that's it.

<p> You can drag things around ; click on the thing and, without
releasing the button, move the pointer to where you want to move
it to and then release the button. If you want to move a group
of things, select them all, and drag one of them. All selected
things follow.

<p>To select several things, you can either hold
[<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>] down and click on each of them in turn or
select them all at once with a selection box. To do that, click
on an empty spot and, without releasing the button, move the
pointer to where you want the other corner of the box to be.
Then release the button&nbsp;; all the things within the box are
selected.

<p>Note that when you start a selection box, everything else is
unselected. If you don't want that to happen, hold
[<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>] down while you draw the box. Thus you can
<em>add</em> the contents of the new box to the selection.

		<h3>Deleting and creating</h3>

<p>You can delete things by pressing [<kbd>Del</kbd>]. It will
delete all selected things or, if there is no selection, the
highlighted thing.

<p> You can also create a new thing under the pointer by
pressing [<kbd>Ins</kbd>]. If, at the moment you press
[<kbd>Ins</kbd>], there is a thing highlighted, the new thing
will be created with the same properties as its "model". Else,
it will have the default properties as defined in the
Preferences.

		<h3>Modes</h3>

<p>So far we've only edited things. Now how do we edit other
objects ? As I've said before, you're in "things" mode. If you
press [<kbd>Tab</kbd>], you will switch to the next mode, that
is the vertices mode. Press [<kbd>Tab</kbd>] again and you are
in linedefs-and-sidedefs mode. Press [<kbd>Tab</kbd>] again and
you are in sectors mode. Press [<kbd>Tab</kbd>] again and you
are back in things mode. You can also use
[<kbd>Shift-Tab</kbd>] to cycle backwards through the modes and
[<kbd>t</kbd>], [<kbd>v</kbd>], [<kbd>l</kbd>] and
[<kbd>s</kbd>] to go directly to a particular mode. 

<p> The other modes work like the things mode except that you
operate on different types of objects.

		<h3>Zooming and the grid</h3>

<p>Use [<kbd>g</kbd>] and [<kbd>G</kbd>] to change the grid
step.
<br> Use [<kbd>y</kbd>] if you want to be able to place
objects "off" the grid.

		<h3>Creating complex objects</h3>

<p>Click on the "Objects" item on the menu bar
or press [<kbd>F9</kbd>] and look at the menu that pops up.
<br>
You can also create a sector from a path of linedefs
by selecting those linedefs and pressing [<kbd>Ins</kbd>].
<br>
You can create a linedef between two vertices
by selecting those vertices and pressing [<kbd>Ins</kbd>].

		<h3>Advanced functions</h3>

<p>Click on the "Misc" item on the menu bar
or press [<kbd>F8</kbd>] in different modes
and look at the menu that pops up.

		<h3>Checks</h3>

<p>Click on the "Checks" item on the menu bar
or press [<kbd>F10</kbd>] and look at the menu that pops up.

		<h3>Saving and exiting</h3>

<p>If you still haven't, please make some modifications to the
level. For example change some textures and light levels and
add, say, a dozen of cyberdemons in the courtyard.

<p>I want you to save the modified level to a pwad named
<code>mywad.wad</code> so that you can test it with Doom. To do
that, press [<kbd>F2</kbd>]. Don't worry, it will not overwrite
your iwad. Individual levels are always saved to a pwad. You
are prompted for a file name. Enter <code>mywad.wad</code>.

<p> Before when go on, here a few things worth mentioning&nbsp;:

<p>
<ul>
<li>
If you press [<kbd>Esc</kbd>], you quit without saving.
If you have unsaved changes, you are asked to confirm.
<br>
If you press [<kbd>q</kbd>], you save and quit.
<br>
If you press [<kbd>F2</kbd>], you save.
<br>
If you press [<kbd>F3</kbd>], like [<kbd>F2</kbd>] but
you can save under a different level name (E.G. MAP02).

<p><li>Whenever you are queried for a file name, remember that
the <code>.wad</code> extension is <em>not</em> automatically
appended. In addition, if you used to be a DOS/Windows user,
remember that Unix treats file names in a case-sensitive fashion
so you'd better think twice before using names like FOO.WAD.

<p><li>When a <code>.wad</code> file is changed, a backup is made
in the same directory and with the same name but with the
extension <code>.bak</code>.

<p><li>I said above that iwads are not overwritten. The same is
not true of pwads. If you edit a level that comes from a pwad,
it will be saved to the same pwad file, unless you specify a
different file name.

<p><li><strong>GOTCHA: when you save to a pwad, everything that
used to be in that pwad is lost !</strong> For example, if you
load a pwad that contains MAP01 and MAP02, edit MAP01 and save
MAP01 to the same pwad file, the level MAP02 it used to contain
is <em>lost</em>&nbsp;! It's unfortunate but not very easy to
fix.

</ul>

<p>Now press [<kbd>Esc</kbd>]. The editing window closes and
you are returned to the Yadex prompt. From there, use the
"<code>e</code>" or "<code>c</code>" commands to edit another
level or use the "<code>q</code>" command to really quit Yadex.

		<h3>Testing your level</h3>

<p><strong>GOTCHA: Before you test your level, you MUST run it
through a nodes builder.</strong> If you don't, you'll get
strange results or you'll crash the game.

<p>There are several nodes builders around. One of the best is
BSP, which you can download from <a
href="http://doombsp.sourceforge.net/"><code
>http://doombsp.sourceforge.net/</code></a>. To build the nodes
on your level with BSP and then test it with Doom, type
something along the lines of&nbsp;:

<p><pre>
$ bsp -o final.wad mywad.wad
$ doom -file final.wad
</pre>

		<h3>Fixing your level</h3>

<p>You've tested your level and you've found that some things
need to be fixed. What do you do ? Well, go back to <a
href="#q_running"> How do I run Yadex</a> except that, this
time, you need to tell Yadex to load your pwad. You do that by
running Yadex with the name of your pwad as argument (you can
ommit the <code>.wad</code> extension). E.G.&nbsp;:

<p>
<code>$ yadex -g doom2 mywad</code>
<p>
That's it&nbsp;! You've been through an entire
edit-build-test-edit cycle. Doubtlessly the first of thousands
:-).
