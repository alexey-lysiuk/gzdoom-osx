    <h2>Compilation problems</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>
	<strong>
	  During configure,
	  <br><code>error: none of (gcc, c89, cc) work, is your PATH set
	  right?</code>
	</strong>
      <dd>
	<p>
	  You need a C compiler to compile Yadex.
	</p>

	<p>
	  If you have one but it's not in the path, either fix
	  <code>$PATH</code> or pass the full pathname to the configure script
	  with the <code>--cc</code> flag (E.G. "<code>./configure --cc
	  /opt/sfw/bin/gcc</code>").
	</p>

	<p>
	  If it's in the path but it's not called <code>gcc</code> or
	  <code>c89</code> or <code>cc</code>, pass the name to the configure
	  script with the <code>--cc</code> flag (E.G. "<code>./configure --cc
	  icc</code>").
	</p>

      <dt>
	<strong>During configure,
	<br><code>error: none of (g++, c++, cxx) work, is your PATH set right?
	</code></strong>
      <dd>
	<p>
	  You need a C++ compiler to compile Yadex.
	</p>

	<p>
	  If you have one but it's not in the path, either fix
	  <code>$PATH</code> or pass the full pathname to the configure script
	  with the <code>--cxx</code> flag (E.G.  "<code>./configure --cxx
	  /opt/sfw/bin/g++</code>").
	</p>

	<p>
	  If it's in the path but it's not called <code>g++</code> or
	  <code>c++</code> or <code>cxx</code>, pass the name to the configure
	  script with the <code>--cxx</code> flag (E.G. "<code>./configure
	  --cxx icc</code>").
	</p>

      <dt><strong>X11/Xlib.h: No such file or directory</strong>

      <dd>
	<p>
	  Are you sure you have the Xlib headers&nbsp;? If not, install them.
	  If you already have them, then find out where they are and change the
	  "<code>X11INCLUDEDIR =</code>" line in <code>GNUmakefile</code>
	  accordingly.
	</p>

      <dt><strong>The compiler chokes on the Xlib headers</strong>

      <dd>
	<p>
	  This happens on Solaris 2.6 with GCC 2.95.2. Oliver Kraus says that
	  the solution is to add "<code>-fpermissive</code>" to "<code>CXXFLAGS
	  =</code>" in <code>GNUmakefile</code>.
	</p>

      <dt>
	<strong>/usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so: undefined reference to `recv'
	<br>/usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so: undefined reference to `connect'
	<br>/usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so: undefined reference to `socket'

	<br>/usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so: undefined reference to `getsockname'
	</strong>

      <dd>
	<p>
	  This happens with QNX 6 and other Unices. Add "<code>-lsocket</code>"
	  to "<code>LDFLAGS =</code>" in <code>GNUmakefile</code>.
	</p>

      <dt><strong>Solaris: can't resolve <code>gettimeofday()</code></strong>

      <dd>
	<p>
	  In <code>GNUmakefile</code>, add "<code>-lrt</code>" after
	  "<code>-lX11</code>".
	</p>

      <dt>
	<strong>Mac OS X:
	<br><code>al_adigits.o literal C string section (__TEXT,__cstring) does
	not end with a '\0'</code></strong>

      <dd>
	<p>
	  As far as I can see, the code in Yadex is legal C, and Mac OS X's
	  <code>ld</code> is incorrect in rejecting it. As a workaround, change
	  the size of <code>al_adigits[]</code> from 36 to 37 in
	  <code>al_adigits.c</code> and <code>atclib.h</code>. The real fix is
	  to complain to <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> for selling
	  you a linker that won't link valid C code.
	</p>

      <dt><strong>GCC 3.0: Yadex 1.5.1 doesn't compile</strong>

      <dd>
	<p>
	  Get Yadex 1.5.2 or later.
	</p>

      <dt>
	<strong>GCC 2.96: Yadex 1.5.0 doesn't compile</strong>

      <dd>
	<p>
	  Get Yadex 1.5.1 or later.
	</p>

      <dt>
        <strong>EGCS&nbsp;1.1.2 / SuSE&nbsp;6.2:
	<br><code>no matching function for call to `menu_c::menu_c (...)'
	</code></strong>

      <dd>
	<p>
	  Apparently, there is a bug in certain EGCS 1.1.2 installations that
	  makes them choke on <code>src/editloop.cc</code>. I know no
	  workaround. I'd suggest that you try to get a fix from your
	  distributor or use another compiler. EGCS&nbsp;1.0.3, EGCS&nbsp;1.1.1
	  and GCC&nbsp;2.95.2 are known to work. 
	</p>

      <dt><strong>GCC 2.7: lots of compilation errors</strong>

      <dd>
	<p>
	  GCC 2.7 is a very old compiler, it does not implement the current C++
	  standard and I don't support it. If you must, try applying
	  <code>patch/gcc-2.7.diff</code> that's included in the archive but
	  don't complain to me if it doesn't work.
	</p>


      <dt>
        <strong>GCC:
	<br><code>warning: comparison between signed and unsigned</code>
	</strong>

      <dd>
        <p>
	  GCC is over-sensitive to signedness mismatches. Don't worry, that
	  won't prevent Yadex from working.
	</p>

      <dt>
        <strong>GCC: In <code>sanity.cc</code>,
	<br><code>warning: decimal integer constant is so large that it is
	unsigned</code></strong>

      <dd>
        <p>
	  Weird as it may sound, the standard says that the lowest value that a
	  signed long can hold is -(2^31). GCC sticks to the party line, never
	  mind that you're on a platform like i386 where <code>LONG_MIN</code>
	  is -(2^31)&nbsp;-&nbsp;1.
	</p>

	<p>
	  You can ignore this warning.
	</p>
      
      <dt>
	<strong>GCC: In <code>sanity.cc</code>,
	<br><code>warning: this decimal constant is unsigned only in ISO
	C90</code></strong>

      <dd>
        <p>
	  This is a new avatar (as of GCC 3.3) of the previous warning. Ignore
	  it.
	</p>

      <dt><strong>Yadex 1.3.1 doesn't compile</strong>

      <dd>
        <p>
	  There's a thinko in the makefile. It's fixed in version 1.3.2.
	</p>

      <dt><strong>Yadex 1.1.0 doesn't compile</strong>

      <dd>
        <p>
	  In <code>src/infobar.cc</code>, lines 48 and 49, replace
	</p>

<pre>  const char infobar_c::FILE_NAME_UNSET[1];  // A special pointer value 
  const char infobar_c::LEVEL_NAME_UNSET[1];  // A special pointer value</pre>

	<p>
	  by
	</p>

<pre>  const char infobar_c::FILE_NAME_UNSET[1] = { ' ' };
  const char infobar_c::LEVEL_NAME_UNSET[1] = { ' ' };</pre>

      <dt><strong>Yadex 1.0.1 doesn't compile</strong>

      <dd>
        <p>
	  In <code>src/vector.h</code>, delete line 44 ("<code>return
	  this;</code>") and compile again.
	</p>
    </dl>

	    <h2>Misc.</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt><strong>I don't have an iwad</strong>

      <dd>
        <p>
	  You can download certain iwads for free&nbsp;;
	</p>

	<ul>
	  <li><a href="ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/doom/doom-1.8.wad.gz"
	  >Doom 1.8 shareware iwad</a>

	  >Strife demo</a>
	</ul>

      <dt><strong>What about a 3D preview&nbsp;?</strong>

      <dd>
        <p>
	  Andrew Apted has written an amazing <a
	  href="http://glbsp.sourceforge.net/files/RenderDiff.gz">patch</a>
	  that does exactly that.
	</p>

      <dt><strong>Yadex is slow, particularly when dragging objects</strong>

      <dd>
        <p>
	  Yes. I plan to replace the current implementation (pixmap) by drawing
	  directly to the window. The difficulty lies in making that without
	  generating a lot of flicker. In the meantime, try the <code>-P</code>
	  option.
	</p>

      <dt><strong>How many people use Yadex&nbsp;?</strong>

      <dd>
        <p>
	  I don't know for sure. Each new release gets a few hundred downloads.
	</p>

      <dt><strong>Why didn't you use &lt;insert speaker's favourite
	toolkit&gt;&nbsp;?</strong>

      <dd>
        <p>
	  I used plain Xlib and not a toolkit for several reasons. Firstly, I
	  wanted to learn Xlib. Secondly, I reckoned it would be easier to
	  translate the existing BGI calls to Xlib than to some higher level
	  toolkit. Thirdly, I feared that depending on a toolkit would hurt
	  portability.
