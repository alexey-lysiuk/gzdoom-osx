.SH NAME
yadex \- a Doom/Heretic/Strife level editor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "yadex \-?" | \-help | \-\-help
.br
.B yadex \-\-version
.br
\fByadex\fP [\fIoptions\fP] [\fIfile\fP ...]
.br
\fByadex\fP [\fIoptions\fP] \fB\-b\fP \fIstring\fP [\fIfile\fP ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Yadex can be used to view, create and modify levels for
\fBDoom\fP, \fBUltimate Doom\fP, \fBDoom II\fP, \fBFinal
Doom\fP, \fBDoom press release pre beta\fP and \fBHeretic\fP.
It also supports, to a lesser extent, \fBDoom alpha\fP,
\fBHexen\fP and \fBStrife\fP.

See \fBREADME\fP for a quick start.
.br
To know what's new in this release, see \fBCHANGES\fP.
.br
The rest of documentation is in \fBdoc/index.html\fP (HTML format).
.SH OPTIONS
Boolean options can be negated by using \fB+\fP instead of
\fB\-\fP.  For example, \fB+v\fP would disable verbose mode even
if \fBverbose\fP is set to 1 in the configuration file. For non
boolean options, \fB+\fP is equivalent to \fB\-\fP (note: the
fact that a misimplementation is documented should not be
construed as an incitement to make use of it).

For options that take a parameter, the option and the parameter
must be in separate command\-line arguments, i.e. you
\fIcannot\fP write \fB\-gdoom\fP.

It is not possible to run options together, i.e. you \fIcan't\fP
use \fB\-dv\fP as short for \fB\-d\fP \fB\-v\fP.

The \fB\-\-\fP "end-of-options" convention is not supported.
.TP
.BR \-? , \ \-help , \ \-\-help

the \fBbenchmark()\fP function for further details.
.TP
.OP d debug
Debug mode.
This option is equivalent to and overrides the \fBdebug\fP
directive of the configuration file.
.TP
.B \-expert
Expert mode. Enforces default choices for certain dialogs. As
those default choices are IMHO not all judicious, I don't
recommend using this option. Check
\fBinsert_vertex_split_linedef\fP and
\fBinsert_vertex_merge_vertices\fP instead.
This option is equivalent to and overrides the \fBexpert\fP
directive of the configuration file.
.TP
.OP f config_file file
