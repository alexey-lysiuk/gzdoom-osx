<p>If you find a bug, tell the <a
href="contact.html#list_yadex">list</a> about it. It's
important. Especially if it makes Yadex crash or lose data.
However, there are a few things to bear in mind&nbsp;:

<ul>
<li>Some bugs are already known (cf. <a
href="TODO"><code>TODO</code></a>). You don't need to spend time
reporting them because I'm already aware of them.

<br><br><li>A vague report like "it has crashed" is nearly
useless. If you want me to fix the bug, you need to be specific.
What's your hardware and software configuration&nbsp;? What
version of Yadex do you run&nbsp;? What iwad and pwads do you
use&nbsp;? What exactly did you do&nbsp;? What message did you
get exactly&nbsp;? I know that collecting all that information
can be time consuming but there's no way around it. Consider
including the output of "<code>make showconf</code>".

<br><br><li>Some bugs don't come from programming errors but
from flaws in the design. So they can't be fixed, unless I
redesign and rewrite a significant portion of the program.

</ul>
