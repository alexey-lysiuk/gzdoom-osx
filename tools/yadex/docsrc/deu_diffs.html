<p>1. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

<ul>
<li> ADDED SUPPORT FOR VERSIONS OF DOOM BEYOND 1.2
  Added support for levels E4Mn. Added linedef and sector types
  introduced with Doom v1.666.
<li> ADDED SUPPORT FOR DOOM II
  Added support for levels MAPnn. Added new linedef and sector types
  (see above). Added reading sector and wall textures from doom2.wad.
  Added definition of Doom II things.
  You now have to replace main= in the config.file by iwad1= and
  iwad2= and invoke yadex with either "-g doom" or "-g doom2".

<li> INTEGRATED INFO FROM DOOM SPECS 1.6
  Corrected linedef types and sector types. Reordered sector types.
  Added new linedef and sector types (see above).

<li> EDITING IN GENERAL
  <ul>
  <li> Highlighting: it does not require as much a precise positionning
    of the pointer as it did (+/-8 pixels instead of +/-4).
  <li> Made PU PD END HOME scroll only 1/6 screen at a time (not 1/2)
  <li> Grid: also highlights multiples of 1024 or 256 or 64. This is
    useful when you are working with small grid steps (E.G. 8) but
    still need to align to 64.
  <li> Grid: you can now have a grid finer than 8 or coarser than 256.
    So you can now do 4-alignment or even 2-alignment. There are two
    new parameters (gridmin and gridmax) in the config file to set the
    low and high bounds (default&nbsp;: 4 and 256).
  <li> Zoom: added 1 extra magnification step (x8).
  <li> Zoom: vertices green crosses and linedef arrows are never drawn
    larger than they would at zoom 1.0. This makes editing of crowded
    areas easier.
  <li> Status bar: added the name of the file the level being edited comes
    from.
  <li> Made checking after moving a vertex onto a linedef much faster. This
    should be a relief when connecting sectors together
  <li> Map: now drawn faster, especially when viewing only a part of it.
  </ul>

<li> EDITING THINGS
  <ul>
  <li> Rotate things with W and X in things mode.
  <li> The thing type dialog is slightly better.
  <li> You can now enter type in the range [-32749, 32749].
  </ul>

<li> EDITING SECTORS
  <ul>
  <li> Added raising or lowering of a group of sectors.
  <li> Added brightening or darkening of a group of sectors.
  <li> Added display of the headroom (ceiling height - floor height).
  <li> You can now enter type, tag, floor height and ceiling height in the
    range [-32749, 32749].
  </ul>

<li> EDITING LINEDEFS &amp; SIDEDEFS
  <ul>
  <li> Added function to remove the 2nd sidedef (make linedef single-sided).
  <li> Added function to make a nook or a boss.
  <li> Added function to set length of linedef by moving either vertex.
  <li> You can now enter type, tag, sidedef x-offset and sidedef y-offset
    in the range [-32749, 32749].
  </ul>

<li> GENERAL
  <ul>
  <li> The slash is also recognized in file names.
  <li> You can omit the ".wad" in the names of patch wads files (after
    -pw, -file, READ).
  <li> Consumes about 20 kB less memory than DEU 5.21 did.
  </ul>

<li> CAN BE RUN FROM ANY DIRECTORY
  <ul>
  <li> The .bgi driver is searched for in the directory where yadex is
    installed (i.e. where yadex.exe is), not in the current directory.
  <li> If the config file (yadex.cfg) is not found in the current directory,
    it is searched for in the installation directory. On the other hand,
    if the config file is specified with -config on the command line,
    default locations are not used.
  </ul>
  Deu was difficult to run from another directory that its own. Now you
  can run it from the directory where the file to edit is, just like you
  do with, for example, a text editor. That's a bit of improvement,
  believe me! And you still have the possibility of having a .cfg in the
  current directory, if you want to have different settings locally.
  You have several different approaches to making yadex available from
  anywhere&nbsp;:
  1. put yadex.exe and the .bgi you need in one of the directories of
     your PATH
  2. add the yadex directory to your path.
  3. make a yadex.bat in one of the directories of your path with the
     line "@&lt;yadex_directory&gt;\yadex %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9"
  Each solution has pros and cons.

<li> DELETED NODES BUILDER. Nodes are NEVER built and you are not queried
  whether to do it. In 1994, the nodes builder of DEU 5.21 was a
  pioneer and we have to thank RQ for having done it. However, in 1997,
  it is perceived as slow and buggy. Better to use an external nodes
  builder (I use bsp 2.1).

<li> SYNTAX OF THE "EDIT" AND "CREATE" COMMANDS
  They now take only one argument. It may be either a complete level
  name (such as "e1m1" or "map01") or a number. For example, "1"
  matches "map01", "11" matches both "e1m1 and "map11", etc. If there
  is not exactly 1 level that matches the argument, a list of levels
  to choose from is displayed. It contains all levels that matched or
  all levels if 0 matched.

<li> LETS YOU USE NEW FLOOR/CEILING TEXTURES
  Understands FF_START/F_END and does the proper additions/replacements
  ATTENTION, BUG: but an old one: if you have a lump that has the same
  name as the texture to display...

<li> SCREEN SHOT, SAVING TEXTURE TO FILE
  When editing, Shift-F1 dumps the current window to a 16-colour GIF
  file named yadex.gif. Works _only_ when in 256-colour mode.
  In the image viewer, pressing shift-F1 saves the current image to a
  file of the same name as the image followed by ".gif". That's the
  only way I know to extract a texture.

<li> LOG FILE
  To help you keep track of time spent on a wad, Yadex writes down the
  number of minutes spent editing in a log file. The name of the log
  file is the same as the name of the .wad file except it has the
  extension ".yl". The log file is _not_ created if it does not already
  exist. Example&nbsp;: if you want to enable logging for /foo/bar.wad,
  you should first create the file /foo/bar.yl.
</ul>


<p>2. COSMETIC CHANGES

<ul>
<li> #ifdef'd out the funny message (assuming this is used by wizards)
  and the "Goodbye..." message
<li> Do not force anymore the name of pwads to upper case.
<li> changed "LineDefs and SideDefs" to "LD &amp; SD" to make room in the
  status bar.
<li> **Spector -&gt; Spectre, **Sargeant -&gt; Sergeant
<li> "Misc operations" menus now have "..." where due.
<li> When drawing the map, negative linedef types and linedef/sector tags
  are now considered non-zero.
</ul>


<p>3. TECHNICAL CHANGES

<ul>
<li> Replaced c:\bc4\lib by g:\dt\bcpp.402\lib.
<li> Replaced d:\bc4\include by g:\dt\bcpp.402\include.
<li> Removed both "-v" from compiler options.
<li> Added "-mh" to compiler options.
<li> Removed "/v" from linker options.
<li> Removed some private functions from deu.h (SelectLevel).
<li> Do not demand anymore that an EnMn/MAPnn entry have a length of 0
  because MAP05 and MAP10 in dyst3 failed that test. Just print a
  warning.
<li> Further externalized paths in the makefile...
<li> Increased overlay granularity (to improve memory consumption).
<li> In the makefile, put explicit /o+ or /o- options in front of all
  modules. The following modules were previously unqualified&nbsp;: edit
  editobj objects things wads aym scrnshot. They now all have /o+.
<li> Put all modules in alphabetical order in deu.h and in the makefile.
</ul>

<p>4. BUGS OF DEU 5.21 FIXED

<ul>
<li> Now you can use wall textures in PWADs without getting "Error
  reading from file" when trying to display the texture in the
  texture selector. Deutex users don't need the -deu option anymore.
<li> The numeric keypad can now be used in menus.
<li> Fixed 4 display bugs in BuildNewMainWad() and ListMasterDirectory
  that were not noticeable on a little endian machine.
<li> Menus work better&nbsp;: static right button state is now ignored (you
  have to press it) and a left button release is ignored unless the
  pointer was on an item when it was pressed.
<li> Texture viewer&nbsp;: fixed minor glitch that showed with BIGDOOR7,
  SKY1, TEKWALL1, TEKWALL5 and some others.
</ul>


<p>5. NEW BUGS

<ul>
<li> For Doom II, some wall textures are not displayed correctly.
  Specifically, instead of SW?BRN1, SW?STARG, SW?STON2 and SW?STONE,
  SW?BRCOM is displayed. Very strange. I don't know why.
</ul>
