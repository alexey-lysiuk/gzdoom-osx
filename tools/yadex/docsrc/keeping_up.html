<p>In spite of my efforts, new versions of Yadex tend to pop up
every now and then. But don't be afraid, I'm vigilant. As soon
as I see one coming, I raise the alarm on the <a
href="contact.html#list_yadex-announce"><code>yadex-announce</code></a>
mailing list. You should have enough time to run for cover.

<p>I'm also likely to post an announcement on <a
href="news:rec.games.computer.doom.editing"
><code>rec.games.computer.doom.editing</code></a> and <a
href="http://freshmeat.net">Freshmeat</a>. Several news sites
such as <a href="http://www.doomcenter.com/">Doom center</a>, <a
href="http://www.doomworld.com/">Doomworld</a>, <a
href="http://www.happypenguin.org/">Linux Game Tome</a>, <a
href="http://www.newdoom.com/">New Doom</a> and <a
href="http://www.linuxgames.com/">Linuxgames</a> have been
witnessed to echo the announcements.

<p>To download the latest version, see the <a
href="contact.html#homepage">Yadex home page</a>.

<p>To know what's cooking (that is <em>if</em> anything at all
is cooking), subscribe to the <a
href="contact.html#list_yadex"><code>yadex</code></a> mailing
list.
