/*
The way the info bar is handled is something of a mess.
In principle, its various text fields should be widgets in their
own right. Out of laziness, said text fields are not and can't
undraw themselves either so the whole box is redrawn everytime one
of the text fields changes. The "pointer position" field is treated
specially ; since it changes very often, it can undraw itself.
