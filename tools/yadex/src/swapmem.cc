   Memory swapping by Raphaël Quinet <quinet@montefiore.ulg.ac.be>

   SWAPMEM.C - When the memory is low....

   Note from RQ:
      Yuck!  I don't like this horrible thing.  The program should be
      able to swap almost anything to XMS or to disk, not only the
      five objects used here (Things, LineDefs, SideDefs, Vertices and
      Sectors).  That was a quick and dirty hack...  I didn't have the
      time to write a cleaner code...

   Note2 from RQ:
      After having tested these routines, I see that they are not very
      useful...  I'm still getting "out of memory" errors while editing
      E2M7 and other huge levels.  I should rewrite all this for GCC,
      use a flat memory model and a DOS extender, then just delete all
      this code...  I will have to do that anyway if I want to port it
      to other systems (Unix, Linux), so why not?
      Moral of the story: never waste long hours writing high-level
      memory swapping routines on a deficient OS.  Use a real OS with
      a better memory management instead.

   Note for CJS:
      It should be easy to include your XMS code in this file.  Just
      add the necessary lines in InitSwap(), SwapIn() and SwapOut().
      You won't need to edit any other file.  Put all your routines
      in XMS.C, with the necessary includes in XMS.H.  Please keep it
      short and simple... :-)
      ... And delete this note once you're done.
