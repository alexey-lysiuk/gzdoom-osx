/*
The edisplay_c class is the interface between the edit_c class
(the edit window at an abstract level) and the various edwidget_c
descended classes (the widgets used to represent the edit window
on the display). Its role is to allow the edit_c class to feel
the bliss that comes from ignoring the gory details of handling
the display in a somewhat asynchronous and optimized fashion.

The other role of the edisplay_c class is to act as a kind of
rudimentary geometry manager for the widgets.

About undrawing :
Some widgets are able to undraw themselves. Some are not. If we
want to undraw them, then we should clear the window and redraw
everything from scratch. That's what the method need_to_clear()
is for; if the widget should be undrawn but can't undraw itself,
need_to_clear() returns true.

For the time being, the set of widgets is hard coded into the
edisplay_c class. But this needs not be. In the future, all this
should be replaced by a loop through a list of widgets.
