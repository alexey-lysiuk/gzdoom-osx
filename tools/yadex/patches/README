These are patches for Yadex that have for some reason not made
it in the stable version. Some were written by me, some by
others.

Please note :

- These patches are not part of the stable version; they come
  with NO WARRANTY (as if the stable version came with any sort
  of warranty). They may not have been given even the slightest
  amount of testing. How long since your last backup ?

- These diffs are against various versions of Yadex, not
  necessarily the latest one or the one you have. Sometimes a
  patch against version X works against version Y, sometimes
  not. While patching, keep an eye open for error messages such
  as "Hunk #n FAILED".

- To apply, try this :

    $ cd yadex-$VERSION
    $ patch -p1 <foo.diff

  You may have to tweak the arguments to patch but -p1 should
  work with most diffs.
