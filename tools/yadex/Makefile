	@echo Sorry, you need GNU make to build Yadex. GNU make can be
	@echo downloaded freely from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/. To
	@echo install it, type \"./configure\; make\; make install\".
	@echo By default, it installs as /usr/local/bin/make so use
	@echo that instead of \"make\" when building Yadex.
