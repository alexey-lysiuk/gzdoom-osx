1. Introduction
----------------

    The excellent program WADWhat has been around for six years by now. So
    why did I change it?
    Well, there is really only one reason to that: in a discussion on
    rec.games.computer.doom.editing, it was decided that it is quite a pain
    to have two versions of the same program around just to have it work
    with both versions of Doom. So I decided that I'd try and change the
    program to do just that.


2. What it does
----------------

    WADSpy takes a look at a Doom map and shows which monsters are present
    on each skill level. Then it calculates the total number of ammunition
    available and, based on that and the number of all the monsters' health
    points, generates a difficulty ratio.
    Aside from that, it also lists all available player starts and thus
    which play modes a level supports.

    Complete list of features:
    - shows which opposition you can expect in a level, either in a brief, one
      line or a detailed long format.
    - shows which maps are contained in a .WAD and which levels they replace.
    - tells which play modes (single, coop, dm) a level supports.
    - lists all available ammunition, armor and health.
    - prints the average brightness, number of secrets, number of nukage
      floors and the number of tagged linedefs.

    What changes to WADWhat are there?
    - new '-m' cmd-line parameter, which lets you specifiy a single level
      from megawads (such as doom.wad or doom2.wad ;-) )
    - thing counting code heavily optimized.
    - brief output was changed somewhat to accommodate all the Doom II
      monsters.
      The downside of this is, however, that the brief output no longer shows
      any player starting points.


3. How to use WADSpy
---------------------

    ws.exe [-Bn[M]] [-M map] file1 [file2 ...]

            -Bn     brief output at skill level n only
            -BnM    brief output at skill level n only, multiplayer
            -M      do output for level "map" only. (note the space)
                    "map" can be either ExMy or MAPxy format.
    Examples: ws.exe -b4 doom2.wad eternal.wad requiem.wad
              ws.exe -m E4M1 doom.wad

    I suggest that you either redirect WADSpy's output to a file or pipe it
    to more.com or, for example, 4DOS' list command.

        ws.exe -m E2M9 doom.wad | more

4. The output
--------------

    Run on Doom II's IWAD with -B4, the output looks like this:

WADSpy v1.0 (07/18/2000)             (c) by Oliver Brakmann <obrakmann@gmx.net>

## Monsters                                              Weapons Equip    RATIO
---tr-sg-cg-im-de-sp-ls-ca-hk-rv-ar-pe-mc-av-br-sd-cy-ic-cs2mrpb-bvsiral-------
DOOM2.WAD:
26  0  2 14 27  0  1 29 23  0  0  0  0  3  0  2  0  0  0 ..D456. B..IR..  0.617
27 18 22 11 21 16  9  7  0 21 21  4  4 13  2  1  0  0  0 1.D4567 BVSI.AL  0.468
28  3  5  6 24  6 17 12  1  7 17 12  5  2  4  0  2  0  0 1.D4567 BVS....  0.982
29 13 21 11 22  0  1  0 15  5  6  0  4  4  1  3  0  1  0 ..D4.6. B.S.R..  0.720

    The first column says which level is displayed, ie. in this case MAP26
    to MAP29. In Doom I, it's similar, E2M7 would show 27 there.

    The following columns show the monsters:
    tr = Trooper            sg = Sergeant           cg = Chaingunner
    im = Imp                de = Demon              sp = Spectre
    ls = Lost Soul          ca = Cacodemon          hk = Hell Knight
    rv = Revenant           ar = Arachnotron        pe = Pain Elemental
    mc = Mancubus           av = Arch-Vile          br = Baron of Hell
    sd = Spiderdemon        cy = Cyberdemon         ic = Icon Thrower

    Please note: the brief output does not list the Wolfenstein guy where the
    long output does. These are used for the ratio nonetheless in both cases.

    The weapons are numbered as in the game, so 1 is the chainsaw, 3 the
    shotgun and so forth. 'D' denotes the double-barrelled shotgun.

    The next columns hold the items:
    B = Backpack            V = Invulnerability     S = Strength/Berserk
    I = Invisibilty         R = Radiation suit      A = Computer map
    L = Light amp goggles

    The last column shows the difficulty ratio. More on that now...


5. On difficulty ratios
------------------------

    The difficulty ratio is the result of all the monsters' health points
    divided by the total amount of ammunition (from all sources) available
    in the map. In other words, the higher the ratio is, the more difficult
    the map is. A ratio of greater than 1.0 means that you can't kill all the
    monsters with all the ammo, but that you have to set them to fight among
    themselves.
    The difficulty ratio provided by WADSpy is supposed to indicate how
    challenging a map is. This, of course, can only be an educated guess,
    because the difficulty of a level is quite a complex thing. For optimal
    results, one should also take into account the amount of health and
    armor available, the layout of the level and also which non-monster
    hazards there are (such as crushing ceilings and nukage floors).
    Anyway, as a general rule of thumb, WADSpy serves its purpose quite
    well, and so I give some sample ratios for some Doom levels.

    Hardest regular Doom I map: E2M4    (0.778, Ultra-Violence)
    Hardest secret Doom I map:  E2M9    (0.915, Ultra-Violence)
    Hardest Episode 4 map:      E4M4    (0.994, Ultra-Violence)

    Hardest Doom II map:        MAP08   (1.423, Ultra-Violence)
    Easiest Doom II map:        MAP30   (0.013, Ultra-Violence)  ;-))
    Hardest Plutonia map:       MAP11   (0.710, Ultra-Violence)
    Hardest TNT map:            MAP07   (0.782, Ultra-Violence)


6. Note to .WAD designers
--------------------------

    I suggest that every new level that is released has an entry in its
    text file that gives its difficulty ratio, so that people know beforehand
    if the level is a walk through the park or hell on earth ;-).
    However, I caution you not to include the whole WADSpy output, because
    that would give away spoilers.


7. Bugs & limitations
----------------------

    Thanks to a report by Javier Almenara, a bug with opening files in
    directories other than the current working directory was fixed.

    To my knowledge, there are no bugs in this program (tho' the original
    WADWhat gives other ratios for some levels. Reason as yet unknown)
    You are welcome to send any bug reports to me at <obrakmann@gmx.net>.

    This program is ignorant of:
    - Skulls spawned by Pain Elementals
    - Monsters spawned by Icon Throwers
    - Monsters resurrected by Arch-Viles
    - Splash damage from rockets and the BFG9000
    - the players' starting with 50 bullets

    Also,
    - WADSpy assumes you do not use the BFG9000
      (shooting 40 cells with the BFG results in 100 points of damage on a
       direct hit, whereas with the Plasma Rifle you'd only get 80 points)
    - there's a problem with the megasphere and the berserk pack, because
      those two items do not _add_ health (& armor) to the player, but rather
      set them to a fixed value. This cannot be correctly taken care of with
      the counting system employed by WADSpy. So as of now, the berserk pack
      _adds_ 100 health points and the megasphere both 200 points of health
      and armor to the player. I'm aware that these values are way too high
      but I don't know how to address this in a satisfying way. But the
      newsgroup should be working on that.
    - the brief output doesn't list the Wolfenstein guy, 'cause I can't fit
      him on the screen. Damn 80 chars limit.
    - for some odd reason, R. Spangler decided to only list the available
      player starts, and not on which skill settings they appear.
      I have kept to that, because I think that most start positions are
      present on all skills anyway.


8. About the source
--------------------

    If you use some of my code in any other program, I'd like you to at
    least mention it. If you're doing that (using my source), you're also
    bound to the GPL. See the file 'copying' for more information.

    If you have any questions about the code, or have some suggestions,
    you are again free to mail me at <obrakmann@gmx.net>.

    Thanks to André Majorel, WADSpy now also compiles fine under Linux.
    He also provided the Makefile and man page.

Have fun,
Oliver
